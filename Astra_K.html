                <hr>

                <p>UK showrooms in October 2015, priced from Â£15,295. The range consisted of 99bhp 1.4, 104bhp 1.0T,
                    124bhp
                    and
                    148bhp
                    1.4T, and 197bhp 1.6T petrol engines; all of these were turbocharged, except the 99bhp unit. A 1.6
                    CDTi
                    diesel
                    motor
                    with 109, 134 or 158bhp was also offered.</p>


                <p>Initially the car came only as a five-door hatchback, but by March 2016 there was a five-door estate,
                    called
                    the
                    Sports Tourer, with the same engines and trims as the hatch. From April 2018 a new range-topping
                    Ultimate
                    trim
                    was
                    offered only on the hatch.</p>

                <p>A facelifted Astra arrived in September 2019 with aerodynamic improvements to improve fuel economy, a
                    nine-speed
                    automatic gearbox, upgraded engines and extra driver-assistance systems.</p>

                <p>All of the engines, gearboxes and trims are decent enough, but the non-turbo 1.4 feels weak compared
                    with
                    the
                    alternatives. Entry-level Design trim gets 16-inch alloys, air-con, cruise control, electrically
                    adjustable,
                    heated
                    door mirrors, all-round electric windows and a seven-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth.</p>

                <p>Each trim adds to that list, with Tech Line also featuring upgraded infotainment with nav, while
                    Energy
                    has
                    17-inch
                    wheels, plus heated front seats and steering wheel. SRi has sports seats, 17-inch rims, auto lights
                    and
                    wipers,
                    plus
                    extra safety systems. The Elite has leather, heated rear seats, dual-zone climate control, and nav
                    on
                    Elite
                    Nav
                    trim. Ultimate adds LED headlights, 18-inch wheels and further safety systems.</p>
